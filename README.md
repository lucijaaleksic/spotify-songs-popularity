## Motivation and problem description
Spotify is a Swedish online music streaming service that allows users to listen to and share music. Founded in 2006, it is currently one of the largest audio-streaming services with more than
365 million monthly active users, and more than 70 million songs. With this, Spotify has a large
by the amount of data about the users themselves and their musical preferences. By analyzing such data
Spotify can maximize end-user satisfaction by suggesting new, undiscovered content.
## Description of the dataset and guidelines for creating the project
SpotifyDB is a dataset taken from Spotify's website and contains descriptions of 232,725 songs. Besides,
features are added to each song, such as: artist name, song name, song genre, duration, tempo,
volume, danceability, tonality, popularity, etc.
When creating the project, be guided by these research questions:
* Do some genres have significantly different tempos?
* Are songs written in a major key more "danceable" than those written in a minor key?
* Can we predict the popularity of a song based on the given variables? Try a few that make sense
combination of variables and determine which one best predicts song popularity.
* Imagine that you are a music producer and you create a certain genre of music. What characteristics would your song have?
should have if you want her to be as popular as possible
